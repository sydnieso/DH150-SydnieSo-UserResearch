### Product Design Challenge: 
This product is designed to encourage users to have an active lifestyle by incentivizing them to raise money for a charity of their choice. Many users, especially those who are in the higher age range of the target demographic may not be as well versed in technology and find it difficult to adapt to phone applications. Raising money for charities through running marathons or longer distance activities may be accessible to some individuals, but others may not have time or access to these events and still wish to raise money for organizations and connect with those that have similar interests. This product will allow people to raise money for charities at the ease and flexibility of their own time, while still being able to connect with a network of people interested in the same charities. Through the design of a friendly user interface, individuals will be able to connect with a network of others in their area who are also wanting to start an activity and share similar charity interests. 
### Target Users: 
This app is seeking users who wish to start or maintain an active lifestyle while impacting others who are in need. In particular, this app is designed to fit into the lives of people with busy schedules and shorter amounts of time to exercise and socialize with people in their community. Although open to any age range of 18 and up, we are aiming to cater to the working age range of 21 to 38. 
### Research Methods:
Through conducting an interview with a recent college graduate who has a busy and active lifestyle, I gathered more information on what individuals look for in an activity application.
