### Product Design Challenge: 
This product is designed to encourage users to have an active lifestyle by incentivizing them to raise money for a charity of their choice. Many users, especially those who are in the higher age range of the target demographic may not be as well versed in technology and find it difficult to adapt to phone applications. Raising money for charities through running marathons or longer distance activities may be accessible to some individuals, but others may not have time or access to these events and still wish to raise money for organizations and connect with those that have similar interests. This product will allow people to raise money for charities at the ease and flexibility of their own time, while still being able to connect with a network of people interested in the same charities. Through the design of a friendly user interface, individuals will be able to connect with a network of others in their area who are also wanting to start an activity and share similar charity interests. 
### Target Users: 
This app is seeking users who wish to start or maintain an active lifestyle while impacting others who are in need. In particular, this app is designed to fit into the lives of people with busy schedules and shorter amounts of time to exercise and socialize with people in their community. Although open to any age range of 18 and up, we are aiming to cater to the working age range of 21 to 38. 
### Research Methods:
Through conducting an interview with a recent college graduate who has a busy and active lifestyle, I gathered more information on what individuals look for in an activity application. 

### Contextual Inquiry Guide (Script)

Today we are here to ask you a few questions to gather information on what people with busy and active lifestyles would look for in an activity/exercise application. Through understanding what kinds of activity/health applications you currently use, we will discuss what you like/dislike  about them. 

Just as a reminder, we are not evaluating you in any way, but we are learning from you about how you look at information online and what works and doesn’t work for you. With this, we hope we can make our product better. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I will be asking in this study — we are simply interested in understanding how you do things online. We will conduct this study mostly as a discussion — I will ask you to show me how you do things using your phone and ask you questions to better understand what you do.

Here’s how the session is going to be scheduled. I will ask you a few general questions about how you search for health advice online. Then we will go through the search tasks you have produced for us. While you are working on the search tasks I would like you to think aloud by giving commentary on what is going on in your mind. You can talk about things you like or don’t like. Feel free to say anything that comes to mind and do not worry about being offensive about the design of the product.

We will record a short video of this interview so that I can go back and review things later to make sure we understand things correctly. We will not use your name in connection with the recording or the results. The videotapes will only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone.
