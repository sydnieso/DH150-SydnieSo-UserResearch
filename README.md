### Product Design Challenge: 
This product is designed to encourage users to have an active lifestyle by incentivizing them to raise money for a charity of their choice. Many users, especially those who are in the higher age range of the target demographic may not be as well versed in technology and find it difficult to adapt to phone applications. Raising money for charities through running marathons or longer distance activities may be accessible to some individuals, but others may not have time or access to these events and still wish to raise money for organizations and connect with those that have similar interests. This product will allow people to raise money for charities at the ease and flexibility of their own time, while still being able to connect with a network of people interested in the same charities. Through the design of a friendly user interface, individuals will be able to connect with a network of others in their area who are also wanting to start an activity and share similar charity interests. 
### Target Users: 
This app is seeking users who wish to start or maintain an active lifestyle while impacting others who are in need. In particular, this app is designed to fit into the lives of people with busy schedules and shorter amounts of time to exercise and socialize with people in their community. Although open to any age range of 18 and up, we are aiming to cater to the working age range of 21 to 38. 
### Research Methods:
Through conducting an interview with a recent college graduate who has a busy and active lifestyle, I gathered more information on what individuals look for in an activity application. 

### Contextual Inquiry Guide (Script):
**(Introduction)** 
Today we are here to ask you a few questions to gather information on what people with busy and active lifestyles would look for in an activity/exercise application. Through understanding what kinds of activity/health applications you currently use, we will discuss what you like/dislike  about them. 

Just as a reminder, we are not evaluating you in any way, but we are learning from you about how you look at information online and what works and doesn’t work for you. With this, we hope we can make our product better.

**Interview Transcript**

And through understanding what kinds of active health activity slash health applications you currently use, we will discuss what you like or dislike about them. And just as a reminder, we are not evaluating you in any way. But we are learning from you about how you look at information online and what works and doesn't work for you. With this, we hope we can make our product better and there are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I will be asking you in this study. We are simply interested in understanding how you do things online and we will conduct this study mostly as a discussion. So here's how the session is going to be. I will ask you a few general questions about how you search for health advice online. And then we will go through the search, search tasks and While you are working on the tasks, I'd like you to think out loud and give commentary of what is going on in your mind. And we will record this interview so that I can go back and review things later to make sure that we understand things correctly. And we will not use your name in connection with this recording or the results and the video will only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone. Is that okay with you?

R: Yes.

S: Okay. So a couple of basic questions on what kind of phone do you use? 

R: I use an iPhone. 

S: And what internet browser do you usually use?

R: Google Chrome.

S: Okay. And for this recording, can you tell us your name and a little bit about yourself?

R: My name is Ryan. I am 31 years old. I graduated from UCLA.

S: So what do you usually use your phone for the most?

R: Probably just looking online reading news stories or scrolling Instagram, looking at Fitness pages and military videos. 

S: Okay, what applications do you use regularly?

R: Instagram, Google. And like AP news, my news app,

S: And how much time in a day do you think use your phone?

R: Um I mean it’s probably a couple hours according to by a usage thing. 

S: Okay. And do you use activity tracker applications or have you in the past?

R: Yes.

S: Yes to you currently use one or?

R: I have a Fitbit activity tracker and I have looked back on my, the installed Health app on iPhone. 

S: Okay. And how well do they usually use when tracking your outdoor activities,

R: The Fitbit application is really good. For it shows my distance pretty pretty accurately, it's nice to look at and see a heart rate throughout days that I've exercised and what I used when I was using it before for this for this reason, it was nice as a sleep tracker as well.

S: And do you use these apps to help you stay on track with working out?

R: No, they're mostly just to look back on see how my workouts have gone.

S: Okay. And when you're tracking your health, with these apps what kind of information do you usually look for? Or like which ones do you find yourself, looking back to look at

R: Minutes of activity and how intense that activity was based on my heart rate. And then distance I ran if I'm doing something like that.

S: And what apps have you used in the past or currently use to help motivate your health and fitness?

R: Mostly Instagram several pages that I follow that have trainers that do really good informational videos and demonstrations and stuff for different exercises. And that's usually what I used to figure out what I’m going to do

S: And when you started following these pages how did you find out about these?

R: They really kind of just from… they all lead into each other I'm not sure what the first one I followed was but this one functional bodybuilding somewhere along the line is like a kettlebell exercise page I clicked on this guy and he ended up having one of the best pages that I've been to so kind of just they build on each other links from from others linked to the ones that I've use more often now.

S: Okay, um and in your opinion what is the most useful source of information when trying to motivate yourself for your health and fitness?

R: I mean, it's probably that it's probably the videos I see other people doing intense exercise and it makes me want to get up off the couch and go do some exercise myself. Okay?

S: Okay, so the product we're working with is designed to encourage users to have an active life lifestyle and incentivize them to raise money for a charity of their choice. And many users, especially those in the higher age range of the target demographic may not be as well versed in technology and find it difficult to use their phone applications. And raising money for charities, through running marathons or longer distance activities may be accessible for individuals, but others may not have the time or access to these events, and still wish to raise money for organizations and connect with those with similar interests. So this product will allow people to raise money for charities at the ease and flexibility of their own time while still being able to connect with a network of people that are interested in the same charities and we are working to make this a more friendly user interface where individuals are able to connect with a network of people within their area who want to start an activity and have similar charity interests so that they can connect those people and potentially do the activity together. So if you were to use an app like this, what would you look for? Or what have you struggled in the past with applications that you think what could be improved on for this?

R: User interface is a really important part of it, I guess. Just being able to understand what different events are available and being able to look at different categories of charities and things like that. I think for me also, maybe having the fitness tracker part of it built into it also. So it's, you know, it's all the same. It's all the same place so that you're tracking that kind of thing while you're doing your your miles for for charity. But mostly, I think I think just when when I have, if I remember correctly about that app, I just didn't really understand how it worked. And there was really not much explanation and I kind of was wondering, more like, how is this raising money? Are we just clicking this thing? That I don't know that people like me and less technologically inclined that I am would would understand. That’s really all I can think of right now.

S: Okay. I think that is sufficient. Thank you for your time!

R: Thank you
